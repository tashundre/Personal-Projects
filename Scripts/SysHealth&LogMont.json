Outcome: a PowerShell script that:
  Checks CPU, RAM, disk, and a few Windows services,
  Writes a timestamped result to a rolling log (CSV or JSON),
  Alerts (console + exit code) when thresholds are crossed.

Collect metrics → CPU %, memory %, free disk GB, key service status.
Decide (compare to thresholds) → healthy/ warning/ critical.
Record (append to file) → CSV or JSON in a known folder.
Alert (fast feedback) → console output + nonzero exit code on critical.
